To implement actual payment functionality:

1. Replace these placeholder files with actual QR code images:
- qr-momo.png (300x300px) - QR code for MoMo payment
- qr-zalopay.png (300x300px) - QR code for ZaloPay payment 
- qr-vnpay.png (300x300px) - QR code for VNPay payment

2. Update payment account details:
- Bank account info should be updated with actual company bank details
- E-wallet merchant IDs should be configured with real accounts
- QR codes should be generated with the correct merchant information

3. Security considerations:
- Store sensitive payment details in secure configuration
- Implement proper payment status verification
- Add payment timeout handling
- Consider implementing webhook endpoints for payment notifications

4. Testing:
- Test each payment method with test accounts
- Verify payment status updates work correctly
- Confirm booking status changes after successful payment
- Test error scenarios and payment failures

Note: The current implementation uses static QR codes. For production, 
consider implementing dynamic QR code generation based on booking details.
